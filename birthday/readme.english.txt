[b]License[/b]

A lot of the code for this plugin is derived from Simple Machines Forum 2.0, whose license is New BSD, and is visible at http://www.simplemachines.org/about/smf/license.php

A good many changes were required to make it compatible with Wedge, and its plugin manager, and these changes are subject to Wedge's license, available at http://wedge.org/license/ - this license covers any and all modifications to the original BSD code.
